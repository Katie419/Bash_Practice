The main purpose of this program was to make connecting to Tryhackme and Hack the Box's vpns faster. 
This script ensures I will not need to enter in the exact path to the ovpn files everytime I want to run openvpn.
I created the format and just need to make sure to add the openvpn commands and file paths inside each conditional.
While making this program, I learned how to get user inputs and store them in variables in bash.
